Also, you should have gone through TrailHead trainings this week. Please report on how those went. What did you learn? Do you feel any more confident about your knowledge of SalesForce. Do you feel like you have a better sense of how to integrate it into ForceCraft? Will you be able to create your initial idea with the knowledge you have now?
