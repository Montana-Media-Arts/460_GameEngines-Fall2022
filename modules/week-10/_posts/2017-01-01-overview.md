# Week 10 Overview <br />


<br />

This week we will go back to the Minecraft world and start to determine how the game will play.  You will all work together to come up with a list of videos that must be completed in order to move onto the next "level".  They will need not only watch the video, but have some kind of "quiz" or assessment that goes with it.   It will be coming up to with a way to move from video module to video module. How will you know when they are complete and what will they need to do to show proficiency or do to "unlock" the next section.  Additionally, they will need to know how to what things the user must do in Minecraft to "find" the next section? Is there a way to integrate SaleForce concepts into Minecraft to get to the next set of videos.

You all must also figure out what should the videos be in each section.  Look through TrailForks to determine this.  What is important? How do you become more proficient?
