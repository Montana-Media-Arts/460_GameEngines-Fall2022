# Homework

This week, it's creating the new gaming world of MineCraft and SalesForce.  What will that look like and how will you "gamify" the learning aspect of SalesForce?

1. Create a short document outlining what you did and how you contributed.
2. Create a walkthrough of videos to learn about SalesForce.
3. Create a one of the quizes or assesements that someone needs to complete to move onto the next section.
4. Talk about how you worked together to accomplish this goal.
5. Turn in a paper that outlines all of your contributions and experience into GitHub and the link into Moodle.
